		<h1>Hitory Of O.S.</h1>
	    <p>As we know, the earlier computers were enormous, in the size of multiple rooms, you can literally move in it. and it remained in that form until the  golden era for computers that started with Manchester automatic digital machine which is the earliest store program computer developed by Victoria university in 1948, in 1960s IBM developed the O.S.360, until the rise of Unix and then changed everything, as mini computers started to appear however it wasn’t small as it is today but according to that time, that’s considered as a great leap in the field of computer developing, till 1980s as by that time computers suitable for homes started to appear and all of that returns to the developing of operating systems that made it easier to deal with such enormous devices.. in 1981 Xerox introduced the star information system which was really a glowing star at that time which inspired apple to present their new G.U.I. which was in a vintage shape related to our now days G.U.I.. More recently, LINUX, an open source version of UNIX developed in part by a group led by Finnish computer science student Linus Torvalds, and in part by a group led by American computer programmer Richard Stallman, has become popular on personal co as well as on larger computers… each O.S. has each own graphical user interface (G.U.I) or gooey as it’s spelled, and it is what variate one system from another</p>
		<h1>Types of O.S.</h1>	
		<li> 1:- the single tasking O.S. which can only run one program at a time </li>
		<li>2:- the multitasking O.S. which run multiple programs concurrent at the same time,    where the processor time is divided between multiple processes, so it is called Time-  Sharing</li>	
		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>Earlier, O.S. starts to exist in the 1960s, so computers before that could only perform one process as calculator or similar performance, but O.S. really started to thrive at the 1980s when the personal computers became popular.. since that O.S. passed through several phases of developing until it became the already known O.S. with all it’s known feature.. </p>
			<p> In 1959, the SHARE Operating System was released as an integrated utility for the IBM 704, and later in the 709 and 7090 mainframes, although it was quickly supplanted by IBSYS/IBJOB on the 709, 7090 and 7094….During the 1960s, IBM's OS/360 introduced the concept of a single OS spanning an entire product line, which was crucial for the success of the System/360 machines. IBM's current mainframe operating systems are distant descendants of this original system and modern machines are backwards-compatible with applications written for OS/360.</p>
		<h2>In modern operating systems</h2>
		<p>Applications are separated from the operating system itself, the operating system code runs in a privileged processor mode in kernel mode or user mode..</p>
		<li>In Kernel mode:- the executing code has complete and unrestricted access to the underlying hardware. It can execute any CPU instruction and reference any memory address. Kernel mode is generally reserved for the lowest-level, most trusted functions of the operating system. Crashes in kernel mode are catastrophic; they will halt the entire PC.</li>
		<li>In User mode:- the executing code has no ability to directly access hardware or reference memory. Code running in user mode must delegate to system APIs to access hardware or memory. Due to the protection afforded by this sort of isolation, crashes in user mode are always recoverable. Most of the code running on your computer will execute in user mode.</li>
		<p>CPU usage is generally represented as a simple percentage of CPU time spent on non-idle tasks. But this is a bit of a simplification. In any modern operating system, the CPU is actually spending time in that two modes</p>

		<p>It's possible to enable display of Kernel time in Task Manager, as in the above diagram. The green line is total CPU time; the red line is Kernel time. The gap between the two is User time.</p>
